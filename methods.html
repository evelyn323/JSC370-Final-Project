<h2>Data Collection</h2>

<h3>Bike Share Toronto Ridership</h3>
<p>From the Toronto’s Open Data repository, we can obtain the data on
Bike Share Toronto’s ridership. On the page, there are several buttons,
one for each year. We inspect the buttons for 2020, 2021, and 2022, and
obtain the links to download the zipped files for each year. Each file
contains twelve csv files, one for each month. Using R, download the
zipped files and unzip them using the <code>download.file</code> and
<code>unzip</code>, then read in the csvs. After reading in the twelve
csvs for each year 2020-2022, ensure that all the variable types are
consistent. Some variables such as the bike id appeared as integers in
one file, and characters in another. Such variables were converted to a
suitable type for consistency. In the case of bike id’s, all were
converted to integers. Then, combine the data for each month into one
large dataframe for the bikeshare data using <code>bind_rows</code>.</p>
<p>Table 1, shown below, depicts the top 5 rows of the combined
bikeshare data. The rows in this dataframe are sorted according to
column “Start.Time”, the starting time of the bike rental.</p>

<h3>Toronto Weather</h3>
<p>From the Canada government webpage, we can access the historical
weather data and select Toronto’s weather station. From there, we select
the month and year we wish to obtain. Start with January 2020. The page
has a table with the daily weather data for that month. Inspect the
table and obtain the xml path for it. Then, using R’s <code>xml2</code>
package, we can read in the html table. We then convert that table to an
R dataframe using the <code>rvest</code> package. After obtaining the
dataframe for that month, note that the table does not include which
month or year it was from, it only includes the day of the month. Thus,
we add the month and year of the table we just scraped to the dataframe.
Repeat this for all months from January 2020 to December 2022. Finally,
merge all of these dataframes to obtain the combined Toronto weather
data.</p>
<p>Table 3, shown below, shows the first five rows of the combined
Toronto weather data.</p>

<h2>Data Cleaning and Wrangling</h2>
<p>Tables 1, 2, and 3, from the previous “Data Collection” subsection,
provide us with an overview of the data we will be using to answer the
question of interest. However, before that can be done, some data
cleaning and data wrangling needs to be done. We will start with the
bikeshare data.</p>
<div id="bike-share-toronto-ridership-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Bike Share Toronto Ridership</h3>
<p>We are not actually using most of the variables in the bikeshare
data, we only wish to obtain the number of daily bike rentals. Here we
will create two counts. The number of daily bike rentals for all
stations, and the number of daily bike rentals for each individual
starting station. Thus we will not clean the variables in the bikeshare
dataset, instead we will wrangle the data to obtain our variable of
interest: daily rental count. We will use the start date of each bike
rental as the day it was rented. So if a bike was rented on January 1st,
and returned on January 2nd, we will count this bike in the January 1st
rentals.</p>
<p>To do this, first convert the start date of each rental into a Date
object.</p>
<p>Then, we will count the number of daily bike rentals grouped by the
starting station and save the date, starting station id, and count in a
new dataframe “count_station”</p>
<p>Table 4, shown below, shows the first five rows of this new
dataframe. Column “n” is the number of bike rentals on that date.</p>

<p>From Table 5, observe that in rows 101-103, the entries in column
“DAY” are not actually the day of the month, but are summary statistics
of that month instead. We remove all such columns in the data. Then,
observe that in column “Snow on Grnd Definitioncm”, there are many
missing entries. Since this variable is of interest, we check the data
to see why, and notice that missing entries mostly occur in the warmer
months with no snow. Thus, we replace all such empty entries in the
column with “0”. Problematic entries in other columns such as “Grnd
Definitioncm” are not of concern, since we are not using those
variables. In fact, we will soon be dropping those unused variables from
the dataframe.</p>
<p>Then, create a Date variable using the variables containing the
month, day, and year (the “month”, “DAY”, and “year” columns in Table 3
and Table 5). Then unused variables (such as flags indicating status of
data collection) were removed, and only the date, maximum, minimum, and
average temperature, amount of precipitation, and amount of snow were
kept. Rename these variables (aside from date) as “Max_temp”,
“Min_temp”, “Mean_temp”, “Precipitation”, and “Snow” respectively.</p>
<p>Then, new temporal variables (such as the day of the week, and
whether a day is on the weekend, etc.) were created for the weather
dataframe using the date variable.</p>

<p>The circles are at each bike rental station, and the colors indicate
the total number of bike rentals from that station for the given year.
Notice that most bike rentals occur in the downtown Toronto area,
especially near the harbor front.</p>

<h3>Summary Statistics</h3>
<p>We will then select the most popular bike station (station with most
total rentals over the three years), and the least popular bike station
(station with least total rentals over the three years). In later
analysis, we will see if the relationship between the temporal and
weather factors differs between the counts of the most popular, least
popular, and all bike stations.</p>
<p>After computation, we obtain that station 7076 (“York St / Queens
Quay W”) is the most popular with a total of 101551 bike rentals
recorded for the three years, and station 7758 (“Driftwood Ave / Finch
Hydro Trail”) is the least popular with only 2 bike rentals recorded for
the three years.</p>
Now look at univariate summary statistics of our variables for the
rental count including all stations in Table 7 below. <br>

<p>From Table 7, notice that the maximum rental count in a day is 28307,
which is vastly more than the minimum rental count of 425 in a day. The
rental count also appears to be right skewed. Notice that variables for
precipitation and snow also appear severely right skewed.</p>
<p>For the most popular and least popular stations, we will only look at
the summaries rental count, as all other variables (e.g. temperature)
are the same across all bike stations.</p>

<p>Notice that there are no zeros as we’d expect, since there are only a
total of two rentals so there can only be two nonzero entries over the
three years. It follows that the dataset we have doesn’t record if there
were no bike rentals on some day. This makes sense, as we calculated
count by summing up the number of rentals recorded. Thus we must take
into consideration that none of the data we plot will record these zero
days.</p>
<p>Also, only having two rentals is very strange. After taking a closer
look at the information for that station, we discovered that station
7758 is not actually a station people can rent bikes from, it is instead
labelled as a “VAULT”, perhaps indicative of a place the bikshare
company uses to store bikes not for public use. In this case, having two
rentals is still strange, and perhaps was due to internal testing. This
is potentially something to look into more in the future.</p>
<p>Thus conclude that this station is not a good station to analyze
daily bike ridership. This report will not be further analyzing this
specific bike station. Perhaps the station with the median popularity
(called the “median station” from now on) will be a better choice, and
as seen below, the median station indeed does produce more reasonable
bike ridership counts. Therefore, in later analysis, we will see if the
relationship between the temporal and weather factors differs between
the counts of the most popular, median popular, and all bike
stations.</p>
<p>Obtain that median station 7685 (“King St W / Brant St”) has total
10450 bike rentals recorded.</p>

<p>In Table 10, notice that the daily rental count for the median
popular station is also right skewed, similar to the daily rental count
for all stations and most popular station.</p>
<p>Now let us take a closer look at Figure 1 below, which is a
visualization of the variables of interest in the data. These
visualizations are the same for all stations because they are by date.
Note that variable “Weekday_num” is omitted as “Weekday” contains the
same information. Note that along the diagonal of Figure 1 is a line
graph of the number of observations. The top right corner contains the
Pearson correlation coefficient between each pair of variables. The more
significant the correlation coefficient is, the more stars there are.
For example, “*” is “slightly significant” (alpha = 0.05) while “***” is
“very significant” (alpha = 0.001). The bottom left corner contains the
scatter plots between each pair of variables.</p>
<br>
<div class="vscroll-plot">
<p><img src="methods_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png" width="672" /></p>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<p>From Figure 4, note that the “Rental_count”, “Precipitation”, and
“Snow” are all severely right skewed, as noted before. Also notice
significant levels of correlation between the “Rental_count” and all
variables. More in depth investigation would need to be conducted to
determine the exact nature of the relationship (linear, periodic,
etc).</p>
<p>There is also significant correlation between the minimum, mean, and
maximum temperatures (which is expected), so perhaps if we were to fit a
model we would only want to select one of the temperature variables.
Also notice the periodic relationship between temperature and date.</p>
<p>There is also a significant imbalance in the “is_Weekday” variable,
which is expected, as there are more weekdays than weekends in a year.
This is something to note as it may skew any results concerning this
variable.</p>
<p>A further point of interest is the scatter plot between
“Precipitation” and “Snow”, where we notice a few outlier points with
both large amount of rain and large amounts of snow. This is
interesting, as rain and snow do not usually occur together in such
large amounts on the same day.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are so many data points that it is impossible to
tell the relationship between some pairs of variables using these
scatter plots. For example, between Weekday_num and Date. This is
acceptable for our purposes, as we are not specifically interested in
the relationship between these variables, just if there are any major
issues that could affect our ability to answer the question of interest.
However, in the future it may be necessary to redo the plots with
perhaps a subset of the data if we desire to model these
relationships.</p>
